# MSc Thesis: Semantic Standardisation and Integration of Non-Coding RNA Data

## Abstract 

The majority of the human genome consists of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) molecules, making their study and understanding fundamental in modern molecular biology. These ncRNAs play a crucial role in genetic regulation and gene expression, becoming essential elements for the diagnosis, development, and treatment of various anomalies in fields such as physiology and genetics.

In recent years, sequencing technologies have facilitated the identification of a great diversity of these molecules. However, the integration of these data has not progressed at the same pace as their discovery, hindering their effective management and analysis.

Although numerous databases are designed to provide information on ncRNAs, a model that allows data standardization and ensures interoperability among the various available resources has not yet been established. To address this, data semantics techniques such as knowledge graphs will be used, employing RDF (Resource Description Framework) to achieve a standardized representation and facilitate the integration of information from diverse sources.

In this work, a schema has been designed to model the available information on these molecules, integrating five datasets. This schema will describe the data of the subsequently created graph. Additionally, to promote interoperability, integration with the knowledge networks BioGateway, using its specific ontologies and annotation resources, and Biolink, adopting its data model to structure and relate the information with other biological data, is sought. Finally, various RDFs are generated and loaded into Virtuoso, enabling queries of greater biological relevance than those allowed by the source databases.
